Among full-time college students aged 18 to 22, those who used Adderall® nonmedically in the past year were more than 1.5 times as likely as their counterparts to have used alcohol in the past month (95.4 vs. 63.0 percent), more than twice as likely to have been binge alcohol users (89.5 vs. 41.4 percent), and more than 3 times as likely to have been heavy alcohol users (55.2 vs. 15.6 percent) (Figure 3). Similar patterns were observed for underage full-time college students (i.e., those aged 18 to 20) who used Adderall® nonmedically in the past year and for nonmedical Adderall® users of legal drinking age compared with their counterparts who had not used it nonmedically (data not shown).
